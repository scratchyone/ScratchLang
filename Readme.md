# ScratchLang

ScratchLang is a C-like language that compiles into [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu). It's goal is to add more powerful features to Scratch such as scoped variables, function return values, and a powerful standard library to allow more powerful programs to be created.

# Todo

- [ ] Allow defining functions with parameters
- [ ] Implement more native functions
- [ ] Allow function returns as inputs without generated variables
- [x] Add variable access
- [x] Add scoped variables
- [x] Add stack
